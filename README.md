# Product Recommendation using Sentiment Analysis for E-Commerce (PRSA)  

PRSA is an advanced product recommendation system designed for e-commerce platforms. It includes three main modules:  

1. **Daraz Scraper**: A web scraper built using Scrapy and Selenium to extract product URLs, details, and reviews from Daraz, storing the data in PostgreSQL.  
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes a fine-tuned DistilBERT model trained on Amazon datasets to perform sentiment analysis, integrated into a Flask API for seamless recommendations.  
3. **Website**: A full-stack application with a Node.js backend and React frontend, implementing JWT authentication. Users can view products and recommendations, while admins can analyze product reviews and manage the recommendation engine. Recommendations are generated using a weighted score of sentiment (60%), rating (30%), and price (10%).  

This project demonstrates expertise in web scraping, natural language processing, API development, and full-stack web technologies.
