FYP Website Backend API

Project Overview:

This project builds a robust and scalable backend API that serves as the foundation for my FYP website. The API interacts with a PostgreSQL database populated with data scraped from Daraz using a separate web scraper (not included in this repository). It provides functionalities for users and developers interacting with product information and sentiment analysis.
